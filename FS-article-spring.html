                <h3 class="article-stitle">SPRING</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons,
                    succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local
                    usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the
                    Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or
                    vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing
                    and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses.</p>

                <p>Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal,
                    resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of
                    other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons
                    which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Natural events</h6>
                <p>During early spring, the axis of the Earth is increasing its tilt relative to the Sun, and the length
                    of daylight rapidly increases for the relevant hemisphere. The hemisphere begins to warm
                    significantly, causing new plant growth to "spring forth," giving the season its name.</p>
                <p>Any snow begins to melt, swelling streams with runoff and any frosts become less severe. In climates
                    that have no snow, and rare frosts, air and ground temperatures increase more rapidly.</p>
                <p>Many flowering plants bloom at this time of year, in a long succession, sometimes beginning when snow
                    is still on the ground and continuing into early summer.[14] In normally snowless areas, "spring"
                    may begin as early as February (Northern Hemisphere) or August (Southern Hemisphere), heralded by
                    the blooming of deciduous magnolias, cherries, and quince.[15] Many temperate areas have a dry
                    spring, and wet autumn (fall), which brings about flowering in this season, more consistent with the
                    need for water, as well as warmth. Subarctic areas may not experience "spring" at all until May.</p>
                <p>While spring is a result of the warmth caused by the changing orientation of the Earth's axis
                    relative to the Sun, the weather in many parts of the world is affected by other, less predictable
                    events. The rainfall in spring (or any season) follows trends more related to longer cycles—such as
                    the solar cycle—or events created by ocean currents and ocean temperatures—for example, the El Niño
                    effect and the Southern Oscillation Index.</p>
                <p>Unstable spring weather may occur more often when warm air begins to invade from lower latitudes,
                    while cold air is still pushing from the Polar regions. Flooding is also most common in and near
                    mountainous areas during this time of year, because of snow-melt which is accelerated by warm rains.
                    In North America, Tornado Alley is most active at this time of year, especially since the Rocky
                    Mountains prevent the surging hot and cold air masses from spreading eastward, and instead force
                    them into direct conflict. Besides tornadoes, supercell thunderstorms can also produce dangerously
                    large hail and very high winds, for which a severe thunderstorm warning or tornado warning is
                    usually issued. Even more so than in winter, the jet streams play an important role in unstable and
                    severe Northern Hemisphere weather in springtime.</p>
                <p>In recent decades, season creep has been observed, which means that many phenological signs of spring
                    are occurring earlier in many regions by around two days per decade.</p>
