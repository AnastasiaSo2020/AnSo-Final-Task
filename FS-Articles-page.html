                <p class="article-text">Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
                    after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that
                    hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start
                    of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere,
                    it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with
                    snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with
                    respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its
                    farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole). The day on which this occurs has the shortest
                    day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season
                    progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar
                    regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to
                    the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see
                    earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).</p>

                <p class="article-text">Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four
                    temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in
                    September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the
                    duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length
                    decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December
                    (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates
                    is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.
                    Some cultures regard the autumnal equinox as "mid-autumn", while others with a longer temperature
                    lag treat the equinox as the start of autumn. In the English-speaking world, autumn traditionally
                    began with Lammas Day and ended around Hallowe'en, the approximate mid-points between midsummer, the
                    autumnal equinox, and midwinter. Meteorologists (and Australia and most of the temperate countries
                    in the southern hemisphere) use a definition based on Gregorian calendar months, with autumn being
                    September, October, and November in the northern hemisphere,[7] and March, April, and May in the
                    southern hemisphere.</p>

                <p class="article-text">Spring, also known as springtime, is one of the four temperate seasons,
                    succeeding winter and preceding summer. There are various technical definitions of spring, but local
                    usage of the term varies according to local climate, cultures and customs. When it is spring in the
                    Northern Hemisphere, it is autumn in the Southern Hemisphere and vice versa. At the spring (or
                    vernal) equinox, days and nights are approximately twelve hours long, with daytime length increasing
                    and nighttime length decreasing as the season progresses.
                    Spring and "springtime" refer to the season, and also to ideas of rebirth, rejuvenation, renewal,
                    resurrection and regrowth. Subtropical and tropical areas have climates better described in terms of
                    other seasons, e.g. dry or wet, monsoonal or cyclonic. Cultures may have local names for seasons
                    which have little equivalence to the terms originating in Europe.</p>
