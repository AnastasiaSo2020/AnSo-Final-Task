                <h3 class="article-stitle">SUMMER</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Summer is the hottest of the four temperate seasons, falling after spring and
                    before autumn. At or around the summer solstice (about 3 days before Midsummer Day), the earliest
                    sunrise and latest sunset occurs, the days are longest and the nights are shortest, with day length
                    decreasing as the season progresses after the solstice. The date of the beginning of summer varies
                    according to climate, tradition, and culture. When it is summer in the Northern Hemisphere, it is
                    winter in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Weather</h6>
                <p>Summer is traditionally associated with hot or warm weather. In Mediterranean climates, it is also
                    associated with dry weather, while in other places (particularly in Eastern Asia because of the
                    monsoon) it is associated with rainy weather. The wet season is the main period of vegetation growth
                    within the savanna climate regime. Where the wet season is associated with a seasonal shift in the
                    prevailing winds, it is known as a monsoon.</p>

                <p>In the northern Atlantic Ocean, a distinct tropical cyclone season occurs from 1 June to 30
                    November.The statistical peak of the Atlantic hurricane season is 10 September. The Northeast
                    Pacific Ocean has a broader period of activity, but in a similar timeframe to the Atlantic. The
                    Northwest Pacific sees tropical cyclones year-round, with a minimum in February and March and a peak
                    in early September. In the North Indian basin, storms are most common from April to December, with
                    peaks in May and November. In the Southern Hemisphere, the tropical cyclone season runs from the
                    start of November until the end of April with peaks in mid-February to early March.</p>
                <p>Thunderstorm season in the United States and Canada runs in the spring through summer but sometimes
                    can run as late as October or even November in the fall. These storms can produce hail, strong winds
                    and tornadoes, usually during the afternoon and evening.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Summer Timing</h6>
                <p>From an astronomical view, the equinoxes and solstices would be the middle of the respective seasons,
                    but sometimes astronomical summer is defined as starting at the solstice, the time of maximal
                    insolation, often identified with the 21st day of June or December. A variable seasonal lag means
                    that the meteorological centre of the season, which is based on average temperature patterns, occurs
                    several weeks after the time of maximal insolation. The meteorological convention is to define
                    summer as comprising the months of June, July, and August in the northern hemisphere and the months
                    of December, January, and February in the southern hemisphere. Under meteorological definitions, all
                    seasons are arbitrarily set to start at the beginning of a calendar month and end at the end of a
                    month. This meteorological definition of summer also aligns with the commonly viewed notion of
                    summer as the season with the longest (and warmest) days of the year, in which daylight
                    predominates. The meteorological reckoning of seasons is used in Australia, Austria, Denmark, Russia
                    and Japan. It is also used by many in the United Kingdom and in Canada. In Ireland, the summer
                    months according to the national meteorological service, Met Ã‰ireann, are June, July and August.
                    However, according to the Irish Calendar, summer begins on 1 May and ends on 1 August. School
                    textbooks in Ireland follow the cultural norm of summer commencing on 1 May rather than the
                    meteorological definition of 1 June.</p>
