                <h3 class="article-stitle">Autumn</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Autumn, also known as fall in North American English, is one of the four
                    temperate seasons. Outside the tropics, autumn marks the transition from summer to winter, in
                    September (Northern Hemisphere) or March (Southern Hemisphere). Autumn is the season when the
                    duration of daylight becomes noticeably shorter and the temperature cools considerably. Day length
                    decreases and night length increases as the season progresses until the Winter Solstice in December
                    (Northern Hemisphere) and June (Southern Hemisphere). One of its main features in temperate climates
                    is the striking change in colour for the leaves of deciduous trees as they prepare to shed.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Etymology</h6>
                <p>The word autumn (/ˈɔːtəm/) is derived from Latin autumnus, archaic auctumnus, possibly from the
                    ancient Etruscan root autu- and has within it connotations of the passing of the year. Alternative
                    etymologies include Proto-Indo-European *h₃ewǵ- ("cold") or *h₂sows- ("dry").</p>
                <p>After the Greek era, the word continued to be used as the Old French word autompne (automne in modern
                    French) or autumpne in Middle English,[17] and was later normalised to the original Latin. In the
                    Medieval period, there are rare examples of its use as early as the 12th century, but by the 16th
                    century, it was in common use.</p>
                <p>Before the 16th century, harvest was the term usually used to refer to the season, as it is common in
                    other West Germanic languages to this day (cf. Dutch herfst, German Herbst and Scots hairst).
                    However, as more people gradually moved from working the land to living in towns, the word harvest
                    lost its reference to the time of year and came to refer only to the actual activity of reaping, and
                    autumn, as well as fall, began to replace it as a reference to the season.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Associations</h6>
                <p>Association with the transition from warm to cold weather, and its related status as the season of
                    the primary harvest, has dominated its themes and popular images. In Western cultures,
                    personifications of autumn are usually pretty, well-fed females adorned with fruits, vegetables and
                    grains that ripen at this time. Many cultures feature autumnal harvest festivals, often the most
                    important on their calendars. Still extant echoes of these celebrations are found in the autumn
                    Thanksgiving holiday of the United States and Canada, and the Jewish Sukkot holiday with its roots
                    as a full-moon harvest festival of "tabernacles" (living in outdoor huts around the time of
                    harvest). There are also the many festivals celebrated by indigenous peoples of the Americas tied to
                    the harvest of ripe foods gathered in the wild, the Chinese Mid-Autumn or Moon festival, and many
                    others. The predominant mood of these autumnal celebrations is a gladness for the fruits of the
                    earth mixed with a certain melancholy linked to the imminent arrival of harsh weather.</p>
                <p>This view is presented in English poet John Keats' poem To Autumn, where he describes the season as a
                    time of bounteous fecundity, a time of 'mellow fruitfulness'.</p>
