                <h3 class="article-stitle">WINTER</h3>
                <p class="article-text">Winter is the coldest season of the year in polar and temperate zones. It occurs
                    after autumn and before spring in each year. Winter is caused by the axis of the Earth in that
                    hemisphere being oriented away from the Sun. Different cultures define different dates as the start
                    of winter, and some use a definition based on weather. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere,
                    it is summer in the Southern Hemisphere, and vice versa. In many regions, winter is associated with
                    snow and freezing temperatures. The moment of winter solstice is when the Sun's elevation with
                    respect to the North or South Pole is at its most negative value (that is, the Sun is at its
                    farthest below the horizon as measured from the pole). The day on which this occurs has the shortest
                    day and the longest night, with day length increasing and night length decreasing as the season
                    progresses after the solstice. The earliest sunset and latest sunrise dates outside the polar
                    regions differ from the date of the winter solstice, however, and these depend on latitude, due to
                    the variation in the solar day throughout the year caused by the Earth's elliptical orbit (see
                    earliest and latest sunrise and sunset).</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Etymology</h6>
                <p>The English word winter comes from the Proto-Germanic noun *wintru-, whose origin is unclear. Several
                    proposals exist, a commonly mentioned one connecting it to the Proto-Indo-European root *wed-
                    'water' or a nasal infix variant wend-.</p>

                <h6 class="article-subtitle">Cause</h6>
                <p>The tilt of the Earth's axis relative to its orbital plane plays a large role in the formation of
                    weather. The Earth is tilted at an angle of 23.44° to the plane of its orbit, causing different
                    latitudes to directly face the Sun as the Earth moves through its orbit. This variation brings about
                    seasons. When it is winter in the Northern Hemisphere, the Southern Hemisphere faces the Sun more
                    directly and thus experiences warmer temperatures than the Northern Hemisphere. Conversely, winter
                    in the Southern Hemisphere occurs when the Northern Hemisphere is tilted more toward the Sun. From
                    the perspective of an observer on the Earth, the winter Sun has a lower maximum altitude in the sky
                    than the summer Sun.
                    During winter in either hemisphere, the lower altitude of the Sun causes the sunlight to hit the
                    Earth at an oblique angle. Thus a lower amount of solar radiation strikes the Earth per unit of
                    surface area. Furthermore, the light must travel a longer distance through the atmosphere, allowing
                    the atmosphere to dissipate more heat. Compared with these effects, the effect of the changes in the
                    distance of the Earth from the Sun (due to the Earth's elliptical orbit) is negligible.
                    The manifestation of the meteorological winter (freezing temperatures) in the northerly snow–prone
                    latitudes is highly variable depending on elevation, position versus marine winds and the amount of
                    precipitation. For instance, within Canada (a country of cold winters), Winnipeg on the Great
                    Plains, a long way from the ocean, has a January high of −11.3 °C (11.7 °F) and a low of −21.4 °C
                    (−6.5 °F). In comparison, Vancouver on the west coast with a marine influence from moderating
                    Pacific winds has a January low of 1.4 °C (34.5 °F) with days well above freezing at 6.9 °C (44.4
                    °F). Both places are at 49°N latitude, and in the same western half of the continent. A similar but
                    less extreme effect is found in Europe: in spite of their northerly latitude, the British Isles have
                    not a single non-mountain weather station with a below-freezing mean January temperature.</p>
